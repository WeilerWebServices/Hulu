Summary
=======

GSFancyText is a rich text drawing library for iOS.


Example
==========

First define the styles using a CSS-like string:

    NSString* styleSheet = @".green {color:#00ff00; font-weight:bold} .gray {color:gray; font-weight:bold}";
    [GSFancyText parseStyleAndSetGlobal:styleSheet];

Then create a GSFancyTextView object to display some rich text:

    GSFancyTextView* fancyTextView = [GSFancyTextView fancyTextViewWithFrame:frame markupText:@"<span class=green>Hulu</span> <span class=gray>Plus</span>"];
    [fancyTextView updateDisplay];
    
Or alternatively:

    [fancyTextView updateDisplayWithCompletionHandler:^{
        // logic to align fancyTextView based on its size
        // ...
    }];


Use the Demo
==========

The open the GSFancyTextDemo.xcodeproj file with Xcode and run the app. For a better viewing experience, it's recommended to compile it to an iPhone, iPod touch, or iPhone simulator.

You can check the GSFancyTextDemoViewController.m file under the demo folder to see how the fancy text is defined. You can also change the parameters and see how it affects the output.
